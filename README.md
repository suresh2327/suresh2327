## About Me

I am a **B.Tech ECE student (CGPA: 9.20)** with a strong interest in **VLSI Design and Verification**.  
My primary focus areas include **RTL design**, **functional verification**, and **digital IC design**.

I have a solid foundation in **Digital Electronics** and hands-on experience with **Verilog and SystemVerilog** for RTL development and verification. I am familiar with **industry-standard EDA tools** and have working knowledge of **UVM concepts** and **AMBA protocols** such as **AXI and APB**. I am actively working towards strengthening my verification methodology and protocol-level understanding.
