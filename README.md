### 🔐 **Password Locking System**

#### About the Project  
This Verilog project implements a **secure password lock system** with user authentication, password management, and alarm features.  
Users can log in using a default or master password, and after multiple failed attempts, the system triggers an **alarm** for security.  
It supports **password changes** after successful login and includes a **real-time display** showing remaining login attempts.

#### Features  
- Secure login with default/master password  
- Alarm trigger after multiple failed attempts  
- Password change functionality post-authentication  
- Real-time display of remaining login attempts  
- Fully tested using a Verilog testbench

### 📡 **APB Protocol Verification – 3-Register Slave Design**

#### About the Project  
This project demonstrates the **verification of an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) slave** with three addressable registers.  
It tests full protocol compliance, including **IDLE**, **SETUP**, and **ACCESS** phases for both **read and write** operations.  
Signal-level visibility and **reset behavior** are validated to ensure robust functionality.

#### Features  
- Write and read operations for 3 slave registers  
- Full APB protocol phase coverage: IDLE → SETUP → ACCESS  
- Displays all APB interface signals clearly  
- Handles invalid access, mismatch detection, and reset testing  
- Modular testbench with structured output  
- _Top 19 out of 120 teams based on design and performance_
