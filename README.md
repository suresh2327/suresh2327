### 📚 Academic Projects

**🔐 Password Locking System**  
## **About the Project**
This Verilog project implements a **secure password lock system** with login control, password management, and alarm features.  
Users can authenticate using a default or master password, and after a configurable number of failed attempts, an **alarm is triggered** to indicate a security breach.  
It includes **password change functionality** accessible only after successful authentication.  
A dedicated display module shows the number of remaining login attempts in real-time, enhancing system feedback and user interaction.

## **Features**
- **Login system** with default/master password.
- **Alarm trigger** after multiple failed login attempts.
- **Password change** functionality after successful login.
- **Real-time display** of remaining attempts.
- Thoroughly tested using a **functional Verilog testbench**.

**📡 # **APB Protocol Verification – 3-Register Slave Design**

## **About the Project**
This project demonstrates functional verification of an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) slave that contains 3 addressable registers.  
It verifies correct protocol behavior including **IDLE**, **SETUP**, and **ACCESS** phases for both read and write transactions.  
The testbench performs comprehensive checks on each slave register, displays all APB signals for each phase, and includes reset behavior validation.

## **Features**
- Supports **write and read** operations for all 3 slave registers.
- Covers **IDLE**, **SETUP**, and **ACCESS** states of the APB protocol.
- Displays all APB interface signals before and during each transaction.
- Includes checks for **mismatches**, **invalid accesses**, and **reset behavior**.
- Modular testbench with clear logging and debugging support.
🏅 _Selected among the top 19 teams out of 120 based on performance and design quality._
