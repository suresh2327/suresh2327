### 📚 Academic Projects

**🔐 Password Locking System**  
Project Description:
This Verilog project implements a password lock system with secure login and password management features. It allows a user to log in using a default or master password, with access control and an alarm trigger after multiple failed attempts. The system supports password change functionality upon successful authentication. A separate display module shows the remaining login attempts in real-time. The design is tested using a comprehensive testbench covering all functional scenarios.


**📡 APB Protocol Interfacing**  
APB Protocol Verification with Custom APB Slave (3 Registers)
This project implements and verifies an APB-compliant slave with 3 addressable registers using Verilog. The testbench covers all APB protocol phases (IDLE, SETUP, ACCESS) and validates read/write operations across all slave addresses. Features include signal-level monitoring, detailed state logging, invalid access checks, and reset behavior testing. Suitable for learning APB protocol or integrating into SoC subsystems.
🏅 _Selected among the top 19 teams out of 120 based on performance and design quality._
